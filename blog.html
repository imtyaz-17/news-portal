                <p class="mt-4">
                    A variable declaration is simply telling the computer that a
                    variable exists and what value it should start with. Similar to
                    other programming languages JavaScript also allows for the
                    declaration of variables. There are three keywords in JavaScript
                    that can be used to declare variables: let, var, and const. Each
                    keyword has different rules and implications for how the variables
                    they create can be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="fw-bold">let:</span>The let keyword declares a
                    block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
                    Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the
                    block it was declared in, which is usually denoted by curly braces
                    {}.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="fw-bold">var:</span>The var keyword declares a
                    function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to a
                    value. Function-scoped means that the variable is only available
                    within the function it was declared in. Global variables are
                    available throughout your entire code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="fw-bold">cons:</span>The const keyword declares a
                    block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable that
                    can't be reassigned. Constants are also called “immutable
                    variables”, but that's a bit of a misnomer since they are actually
                    variables - just ones that can't be reassigned.

                <h1>The Difference Between Regular Functions and Arrow Functions</h1>
                <p>
                    Arrow functions are a great feature added in ES6. ES6 was released
                    in the year 2015. According to my own personal experience, I would
                    prefer to use the arrow function every time I have the chance. This
                    is due to the fact that the codes that use Arrow functions are clear
                    and simple to read when compared with regular functions.
                    Additionally, I am comfortable using the arrow function. When arrow
                    functions are used in a way regular functions can't be completely
                    replaced by Arrow functions. In some instances, which require
                    regular functions. This means that arrows aren't the solution for
                    all illnesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">1. Syntax </span> The functions we define
                    with the function keyword are referred to as regular functions.
                    keyword function keywords are known as regular functions. Regular
                    functions can be defined by two methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">2. "this" keyword </span> This keyword is
                    used in regular functions. It depends on the context of execution.
                    Arrow functions are not like regular functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">3. Using a new keyword </span> Regular
                    functions that are created with function declarations, expressions,
                    or both, can be called and constructed. Regular functions can be
                    constructed; they can also be called with the new keyword. The arrow
                    functions cannot be called and are not constructible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">4. No duplicate named parameters </span>
                    Arrow functions can never have duplicate named parameters, whether
                    in strict or non-strict mode. For regular functions, we can use
                    duplicated named parameters in non-strict modes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="fw-bolder">5. Arguments binding </span> The Regular
                    function can use Arguments keywords to access the arguments that
                    were passed to it.

                <p>
                    <span class="fw-bold">.forEach() </span> Function .forEach() is
                    another form of just a plain for loop that can be used to iterate
                    through array items. This case of a function is used for more
                    complex arrays, for example, an array of objects with a lot of
                    entries than just an array of integers. This function takes 1
                    parameter .forEach(callback). The parameter callback can take up to
                    3 parameters element, index & array (but only the element parameter
                    is required, the rest is optional).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="fw-bold">.map()</span>Function .map() is a manipulative
                    function that can modify each element’s content in an array that it
                    is called on. This function returns a new array with modified
                    values, the array that it is called on will stay still. This
                    function is useful for adding a little change to an already existing
                    array, for example adding a property to an object or modifying it.
                    Its construction and use are identical to the previous function
                    .forEach() and both can be used interchangeably.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="fw-bold">.filter() </span> Function .filter() is a
                    search function that returns all the elements that fulfil the
                    assigned condition. You can search by simple terms, for example,
                    that element is equal to a certain integer, or by more advanced
                    terms, for example, searching for an object with certain property
                    that is equal to something. Both examples have a very frequent use
                    as a developer. This function returns an array of found results, if
                    any, even if only 1 match is found. If a function does not find any
                    match, it simply returns an empty array.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="fw-bold">.find() </span> Function .find() is also a
                    search function like the previous but they differ in one small
                    detail — this function returns only one match in an array. If in an
                    array is more than one result, the function will return the first
                    that has matched. Just like the function .forEach(), this function
                    also takes only 1 parameter .find(callback). The parameter callback
                    can take up to 3 parameters element, index & array (but only the
                    element parameter is required, the rest is optional).

                <h1>Template strings</h1>
                <p>
                    Template strings are supported by almost all browsers that are
                    regularly maintained today. The only major one that doesn’t support
                    it right out of the box is Internet Explorer. However, browsers that
                    do not support it can add it with Babel. Node.js also supports it in
                    version 4 or later. Template strings are the new standard for
                    JavaScript strings. It is much better than strings before ES6 in
                    that it supports interpolating expressions inside strings. We also
                    have tagged templates which are just functions, with the decomposed
                    parts of the template string as parameters. The constant string in
                    the first parameter is the string in a decomposed array form, and
                    the evaluated versions of the expressions in the order they appeared
                    in the string are the remaining arguments. Tagged template functions
                    can return any variable type.
